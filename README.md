# No Code Frames Project

## Introduction

The No Code Frames Project allows users to interact with blockchain smart contracts without writing any code. By simply entering a contract address, users can fetch all available functions from the contract's ABI and select which functions to include in their frames. This project streamlines the development process and makes smart contract functionalities more accessible to a broader audience.

## Features

- **Easy Interaction**: Enter a contract address and automatically fetch all available functions from its ABI.
- **Function Selection**: Choose which functions to include in your frames without writing any code.
- **Improved Accessibility**: Enables non-developers to interact with blockchain smart contracts.

## Problem It Solves

The No Code Frames Project solves the challenge of integrating and interacting with smart contracts on blockchain networks without requiring extensive coding knowledge. It simplifies the process for users, making it easier for developers and non-developers alike to leverage smart contract functionalities.

## Challenges

1. **Learning Farcaster**: Understanding how to use Farcaster for integrating social elements and interactions within the frames.
2. **Fetching ABIs**: Implementing the logic to accurately fetch and decode ABIs from given contract addresses.
3. **API Development**: Creating APIs to handle ABI fetching, function selection, and interaction, and connecting these APIs with MongoDB for data storage and retrieval.
4. **MongoDB Integration**: Ensuring smooth integration with MongoDB for storing contract addresses, ABIs, and user-selected functions, maintaining data integrity and performance.

## Usage

1. **Enter Contract Address**: Input the smart contract address in the provided field.
2. **Fetch Functions**: The project will fetch all available functions from the contract's ABI.
3. **Select Functions**: Choose which functions to include in your frames.
